        <li>Scroll down to the <strong>Actions</strong> section.</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Log out</strong>, then contact us to request full account deletion.</li>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>What happens after deletion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your account and all associated data (notebooks, notes, tasks) will be permanently deleted from our servers.</li>
        <li>Any locally stored data on your device will remain until you uninstall the app.</li>
        <li>The deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.</li>
        <li>We do not store a copy of your data after deletion and we do not offer a data export option through this process (you can export your notes from within the app before deletion).</li>
        <li>Purchase records may still be retained by Google Play or the App Store for billing purposes. We do not have access to this information.</li>
      </ul>
